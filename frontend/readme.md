# Online Courses - Frontend

For the frontend I used Angular 8. The website is responsive, adapting to a wide range of resolutions. I made the forms with the Angular Material library.

## Installation

To get the frontend up and running follow these steps:

 - Install Node JS.
 - Execute the following commands in the frontend directory of the project.
   ```
   npm install
   ng serve
   ```
